#Rufure Scripts
This folder contains scripts attached to the first part of my URECA project, nicknamed Rufure. It contains most of the trial scripts 
used to test out the movement of a sphere, and in particular, the RufureFlick script is the one where we experimented with serial inputs 
when it is connected to an Arduino microcontroller with IR sensors to enable finger motion interaction.
